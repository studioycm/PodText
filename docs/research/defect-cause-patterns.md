# Defect cause-pattern ledger

Started 2026-08-03 by the dashboard route-plan orchestrator session. Every
defect found in the Prompt 13 round traces to a repeatable cause-pattern; each
entry here turns one finding into a search prompt for similar cases elsewhere.

**Protocol.** Side-sessions append candidate entries (or sightings under an
existing entry) with evidence — file, commit, one-line mechanism — and return
an "open flags + pattern evidence" section in their final report. The
orchestrator merges and dedupes. When a pattern accumulates **2+ sightings
beyond its founding evidence**, it gets a targeted sweep task of its own.

Entry format: **name** · one-line cause · evidence (where it already bit, with
commits) · where else to look (concrete greps/paths) · status.

---

## P1 · Value duplicated instead of routed through one home

- **Cause:** a constant (colour, timezone, format string, label) is retyped at
  each use site instead of read from one owner, so sites drift independently.
- **Evidence:** dashboard colour drifts fixed by `FunnelStage`/`DashboardReason`
  (`dc0cd7a`), three more by `DashboardTier` (`4bd4030`); `Asia/Jerusalem` in
  ~50 files consolidated (`44219ad`); enum labels hand-written in two places
  (E4, `96af988`); date/number formats still scattered (F1/F2 open).
- **Where else:** `grep -rn "d/m/Y" app resources` (52 app-wide, 10 dashboard);
  `grep -rn "number_format(" app resources` (5 dashboard); raw Tailwind palette
  classes outside enum homes (218 app-wide — parked, separate budget);
  duplicated literals across `lang/en` + `lang/he`.
- **Status:** open — F1/F2 close the dashboard-scope formats this round;
  app-wide sweep is parked deliberate work.

## P2 · An enum beside hand-written values protects nothing

- **Cause:** creating the enum is half the work; a value is only safe from
  drift once **every call site** reads it from the enum. Unrouted sites keep
  drifting next to a correct-looking type.
- **Evidence:** proven three separate times in phase 2R (handoff contract
  line); colour drifts persisted after the enums existed until call sites were
  routed (`4bd4030`).
- **Where else:** for each enum in `app/Enums`, grep its literal backing values
  outside the enum file; `ActivityStreamWidget` hand-writes event-type colours
  (known open → `StreamEventType`, phase 3).
- **Sighting (2026-08-03, V1):** the generalized form — a *contract* enforced
  only on hand-listed members protects nothing outside the list. The stock/flow
  tag rule was asserted per named widget, so `PublicFormTargetWarningsWidget`
  shipped untagged and `BlockersQueueWidget` had never been tagged. Fixed with
  a structural loop over every lens registration in
  `DashboardOverviewLensTest`.
- **Status:** open as a rule; `StreamEventType` lands in phase 3.

## P3 · Live unvalidated state read raw

- **Cause:** state persisting across requests (`#[Url]`, session-persisted
  filters, Filament `pageFilters`) is consumed without narrowing, so a stale or
  hostile value reaches queries/rendering.
- **Evidence:** `$this->pageFilters` consumed unvalidated (Filament docs warn
  it is user input); fixed by narrowing in `ReadsDashboardFilters` (phase 2R).
- **Where else:** `grep -rn "#\[Url" app`; `grep -rn "pageFilters" app`;
  Livewire public properties fed into queries without validation;
  session-persisted table filter state.
- **Status:** dashboard fixed; app-wide sweep candidate (needs a second
  sighting).

## P4 · Shared implicit keys

- **Cause:** components rely on a key (query-string, pagination, `wire:key`,
  schema component key) that is implicitly derived, so it collides between
  siblings or shifts when a list changes.
- **Evidence:** blockers queue table shared the page's query-string keys
  (fixed, `queryStringIdentifier`); pagination keys namespaced per component
  (`2e786ed`); M2 stale-memo clone graft fixed by per-mount key nonce
  (`0b99bf8`); `->key()` on a schema Section re-keys its **children** (`HasKey`
  inheritance, E5 session finding).
- **Where else:** admin tables lacking `queryStringIdentifier`; index-derived
  Livewire widget keys that shift when a lens's widget list changes (V3 checks
  this round); `grep -rn '\->key(' app/Filament`.
- **Status:** multiple fixes landed; V3 verifies the residual this round.

## P5 · Proxy metrics teach tests wrong expectations

- **Cause:** a metric computed from a proxy column gets encoded into a test, so
  the test asserts the bug and defends it against the fix.
- **Evidence:** "became visible" bucketed by `published_at`; the test encoded
  the proxy; fixed with `becameVisibleAt()` (`ce15d96`).
- **Where else:** any day/count derived from a column that is not the event
  itself; the 12 deliberately-hardcoded-timezone test files are a **partial**
  oracle until F2 adds a near-midnight fixture (Jerusalem vs UTC only diverge
  within an hour of midnight).
- **Status:** fixed instance; F2's fixture is the open guard.

## P6 · Silent caps

- **Cause:** `take($limit)` / traversal caps drop the tail with no signal —
  the display reads as "everything" when it is not (no-silent-caps rule).
- **Evidence:** breakdown `take($limit)` drops podcasts beyond six (F3 open);
  Storage panel candidate list caps at 50 breadth-first over the whole public
  disk (M1, decided: real pagination).
- **Where else:** `grep -rn "take(" app/Support/Dashboard app/Filament/Widgets`;
  `grep -rn "limit(" app/Support/Dashboard`; `storage_candidate_limit` users.
- **Status:** open — F3 this round; M1 queued separately.

## P7 · "Flake" labels hiding real defects

- **Cause:** an intermittent failure is the click/timing distribution of a
  deterministic defect; the flake label stops the investigation.
- **Evidence:** M2 at ~13% was called a flake twice before the deterministic
  race repro (closed, `0b99bf8`); the `return_guard_released` "flake"
  was a real test defect (`3cc4906`); `OwnerImageWorkspaceBrowserTest` failed
  ~1-in-4 standalone — **resolved 2026-08-03: 10/10 clean post-M2**, same
  per-mount-key mechanism; a 1/30 Storage-listing timeout remains
  unclassified.
- **Where else:** any browser test with a re-run habit; the parallel-worker
  port/storage collision hypothesis (`local_51579218`) for the residual
  intermittents (now only the 1/30 Storage-listing timeout).
- **Status:** V2 closed the owner-image sighting; only the unclassified 1/30
  timeout remains under watch.

## P8 · Line-based guards miss multi-line call sites

- **Cause:** an anti-drift guard that greps single lines misses the same call
  formatted across lines; guards must scan statements, not lines.
- **Evidence:** phase 2R anti-drift trap notes (handoff); the timezone guard's
  shape cannot be copied naively.
- **Where else:** the F1 formats/colour guard (binding requirement); audit any
  existing source-scanning tests for line-anchored regexes.
- **Status:** binding requirement on F1.

## P9 · `->options(Enum::class)` changes state type, not just labels

- **Cause:** passing an enum class to `->options()` installs an
  `EnumStateCast`, so field state becomes an enum instance; a string-typed
  backing property then mismatches (or the inverse). The field's state type and
  the property's type must agree.
- **Evidence:** E4 hit on `AdminUxSettings::$media_naming_strategy`; E5 typed
  the four properties (`9859145`) with a repair migration and the settings-row
  invariant test.
- **Where else:** `grep -rn "options(.*::class" app/Filament` cross-checked
  against backing property types; `PublicContentSettings`'s ten string
  properties (deliberately untyped — six enums must exist first); dynamic
  settings writers (`SettingsBackupManager::applyPayload()`,
  `NormalizePublicContentSettings`) — V4 decided: **guarded**.
- **Status:** E5 closed; V4 (2026-08-03) added the raw-writer invariant to
  `SettingsRowInvariantTest` — CI fails if `PublicContentSettings` ever gains
  an enum-typed property while the raw writers exist, with the detector
  sanity-checked against `AdminUxSettings`. Both writer sites carry the
  constraint note.

## P10 · Concept without a type home

- **Cause:** a domain concept exists only as query shapes or array literals;
  nothing owns its invariants until a type does, so every use site re-derives
  them slightly differently.
- **Evidence:** blocker tiers existed only as query shapes until
  `DashboardTier` (`4bd4030`); reasons until `DashboardReason` (`dc0cd7a`).
- **Where else:** stream event types (phase 3, `StreamEventType`); the
  "format" concept until F1's localization home; provider/source strings on
  intake paths (Board 3).
- **Status:** recurring; F1 closes the formats instance this round.

### V1 record (2026-08-03)

`PublicFormTargetWarningsWidget` audit: `AdminOnlyWidget` ✅, no polling ✅,
skeleton ✅, en+he keys ✅, lens/order tests green after the index shift ✅.
Fixed: missing stock/flow tag (and the same gap on `BlockersQueueWidget`),
replaced the hand-listed tag test with a structural loop over every lens
registration; `PublicFormTargetStatus` scoped per request with a counts memo so
canView + render compute once (was two full recounts per render).
**EditorialMetrics verdict: legitimately domain-owned.** Its write paths
(settings saves, `HomepageSection`) are outside `EditorialMetrics`' observer
invalidation, so folding the counts into the cached snapshot would show a stale
warning for up to 60s after the very edit that fixes it.
